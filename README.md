###  Reality check
I'm actually a **1st-year college university dropout.** Unemployed. **I'm not that smart** and ain't a vibecoder either. I just do best for myself. Story short, *I can't code* but programs using different LLMs.

## Short messege

```
Shut the FUCK up and go DO IT.
You’ve thought about it long enough— DO IT.
Think while doing it.

People love to pretend they’re smart (without even knowing), forgetting that half their “ideas” aren’t even theirs.
They chase dopamine from imagining someone else’s success, not realizing none of it is theirs.

So… why not you?

It’s simple:

Shut the FUCK up and go do something MAGNIFICENT.
Silence the thoughts you’re not acting on.
If you won’t execute, those thoughts are useless, fucking TRASH.

DO IT, and build while thinking.
Follow your plan.
Follow your dreams.
Follow your goals.
THINK while doing it.

Don’t just die without achieving something meaningful.
Don’t just regret anything you never even tried.
Don’t just feel defeated when you haven’t even stepped to try it.

If you’re tired—Reset, Rest, Recover, Repair.
Then get back up if you're refereshed.

Don’t forget to SHUT your fucking thoughts if you’re not acting upon it.
Don’t forget to ACT upon your thoughts if you keep thinking about them.

You’re ALIVE
But you are killing the best version of yourself every day you choose not to operate in a functional way.

This message isn’t for everyone.
But if it hit you, then maybe it was for you.
```
